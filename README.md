Arduino DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

This repository contains code and instructions for using the DS18B20 temperature sensor with an Arduino microcontroller. The DS18B20 is a digital temperature sensor that provides 9-bit to 12-bit Celsius temperature measurements. It communicates over a 1-Wire bus that requires only one data line for communication with the Arduino.
